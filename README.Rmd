from the paper _Isotonic Regression Under Adversarial Sign Corruption_ by
Matey Neykov, Shamindra Shrotriya.

- [Matey Neykov](https://mateyneykov.com/)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) using `pak`:

``` r
# install.packages("pak") # Run this if you haven't installed pak
pak::pkg_install("shamindras/ascifit")
```

or alernatively using `devtools`:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") # Run this if you haven't installed devtools
devtools::install_github("shamindras/ascifit")
```

```
